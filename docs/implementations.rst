Implementations
===============

There are several implementations of RecipeMD. We maintain a :doc:`reference implementation written in Python
<reference_implementation>` reference implementation written in Python, which can be used as a :doc:`CLI program <cli>` and as a
:doc:`python library <_apidoc/recipemd>`.

To our knowledge the following other implementation exist:

* Rust: `recipemd-rs <https://github.com/d-k-bo/recipemd-rs>`_
* TypeScript: `recipemd-ts <https://github.com/d-k-bo/recipemd-ts>`_

If you maintain another implementation of RecipeMD, we'd like to include it here. Please `send a pull request
<https://github.com/RecipeMD/RecipeMD/edit/master/docs/implementations.rst>`_ or `open an issue
<https://github.com/RecipeMD/RecipeMD/issues>`_ to add to this page.
