   contain the root `toctree` directive.

RecipeMD
========

A :doc:`standard format <specification>` for recipes as `Markdown <https://commonmark.org>`_ files and a
:doc:`python reference implementation <reference_implementation>`. The reference implementation can be used as a
:doc:`CLI program <cli>` and as a :doc:`python library <_apidoc/recipemd>`.

Quick Start
-----------

1. Install the tool: ``pip install recipemd`` (optionally you can also :ref:`install shell completions<install_completions>`)
2. Look at some `example recipes <https://github.com/tstehr/RecipeMD/tree/master/examples>`_ or start with a
   `recipe template <https://github.com/tstehr/RecipeMD/tree/master/examples/template.md>`_ to create your own recipes
3. Learn how to use the CLI tool with some :ref:`example calls <cli_examples>`

Specification
-------------

We provide a  :doc:`specification <specification>` for RecipeMD so other tools can use the format. The specification
also comes with a set of `testcases <https://github.com/tstehr/RecipeMD/tree/master/testcases>`_.
